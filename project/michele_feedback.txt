I like the design of your app a lot. It looks like the future and looks very pretty. The choice of font is very nice too, as are the choice of colors - looks very professional. My main piece of advice for the design of the app is to make the buttons look more obvious. Right now, the text, the list chooser, and the buttons to start / stop the alarm all look like plain text. One way to make them look more like buttons is to change the background / text color to make them not blend in with the background. There are many other ways, too, but this is just one option. 

For how the app works, great job figuring out how to make an alarm work. There is a slight problem, because the alarm only goes off two minutes AFTER the time I set - I have no idea why this could be happening unless you send me screenshots of your blocks editor. Great job.
